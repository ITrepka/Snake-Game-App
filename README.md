## Description
Snake Game is a simple and classic game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it when the game is over. The snake grows longer as it eats food, making the game progressively challenging.

## Features
- Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat.
- Collision detection with the walls and the snake's own body.
- Score tracking and game over display.

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.


## Tests
The Snake Game project includes a set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the game's functionality. The tests cover different aspects of the SnakeGame class and validate various game scenarios. Before runinng the tests, make sure that you have JUnit set up in your development environment.
